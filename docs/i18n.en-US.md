# Single file built version

You can import the corresponding language file via `<script>` directly, the language will be 
registered automatically.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/intact/dist/intact.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/kpc/dist/kpc.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/kpc/dist/i18n/en-US.min.js"></script>
```

# Import via webpack

If you are using multi-file built version, you can import the corresponding language in the entry 
file and call `localize` function to register it like bellow

```js
import {localize} from 'kpc';
import i18n from 'kpc/i18n/en-US';

localize(i18n);
```

# `_$(key, [data])` function

KPC provides a `_$(key, [data])` function that can be used to internationalize non-kpc components. 
First we call the `localize(data)` function mentioned above to register all translation dictionaries.

```js
import {localize} from 'kpc';
import i18n from 'kpc/i18n/en-US';

const dict = {
    '测试': 'test'
};

// merge dictionaries of kpc and customized and pass to localize function 
localize({...dict, ...i18n});
```

Then we can call `_$` function to get the translation results.

```vdt
import {_$} from 'kpc';

<Button>{{ _$('测试') }}</Button>
```

## Pramameter Description

1. `key` the key to get transition results, if it doesn't exist in the dictionaries, return the `key` directly. 
So when we use Chinese as key, you don't need to provide Chinese translation dictionaries, it will 
return Chinese key directly. The key support get value by path like `lodash`.

2. `data` additional data. Through it we can implement variable substitution, as well as singular 
and complex transformations in English, for example:

```js
const dict = {
    '最多选择{n}项': 'Please select no more than {n} item{s:n}.'
};
localize(dict);

_$('最多选择{n}项', {n: 1}); // output: Please select no more than 1 item.
_$('最多选择{n}项', {n: 2}); // output: Please select no more than 2 items.
```

You can see `{n}` has been substituted. `{s:n}` means when `n` is greater than `1`, output `s`. 
For this case which singular and complex need changing suffix, you can do it like this: `lea{f|ves:n}` 
`wom{an|en:n}`
